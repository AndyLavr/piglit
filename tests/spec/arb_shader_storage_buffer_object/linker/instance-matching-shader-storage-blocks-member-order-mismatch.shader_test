/* Tests that no link error occurs when two different but equally

 * between the vertex and fragment shaders.
 *
 * GLSLangSpec.1.50.11, 4.3.7 Interface Blocks:
 * "The block name (block-name) is used to match interfaces: an output
 *  block of one pipeline stage will be matched to an input block with
 *  the same name in the subsequent pipeline stage. For uniform blocks,
 *  the application uses the block name to identify the block.
 *
 *  ...
 *
 *  Outside the shading language (i.e., in the API), members are
 *  similarly identified except the block name is always used in place
 *  of the instance name (API accesses are to interfaces, not to
 *  shaders)."
