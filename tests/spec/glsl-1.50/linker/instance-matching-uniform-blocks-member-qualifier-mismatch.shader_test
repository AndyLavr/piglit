# Tests that no link error occurs when two different but equally
# instanced interface blocks differ only in a member's qualifier
# between the vertex and fragment shaders.
#
# GLSLangSpec.1.50.11, 4.3.7 Interface Blocks:
# "The block name (block-name) is used to match interfaces: an output
#  block of one pipeline stage will be matched to an input block with
#  the same name in the subsequent pipeline stage. For uniform blocks,
#  the application uses the block name to identify the block.
#
#  ...
#
#  Outside the shading language (i.e., in the API), members are
#  similarly identified except the block name is always used in place
#  of the instance name (API accesses are to interfaces, not to
#  shaders)."
