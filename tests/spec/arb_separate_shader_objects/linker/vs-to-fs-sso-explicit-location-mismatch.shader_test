// From the ARB_separate_shader_objects spec v.25:
//
//  " With separable program objects, interfaces between shader stages
//    may involve the outputs from one program object and the inputs
//    from a second program object.  For such interfaces, it is not
//    possible to detect mismatches at link time, because the programs
//    are linked separately.  When each such program is linked, all
//    inputs or outputs interfacing with another program stage are
//    treated as active.  The linker will generate an executable that
//    assumes the presence of a compatible program on the other side
//    of the interface.  If a mismatch between programs occurs, no GL
//    error will be generated, but some or all of the inputs on the
//    interface will be undefined."
